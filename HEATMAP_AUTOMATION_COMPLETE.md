## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS - BTC 24H HEATMAP

### WHALE TARGETS IDENTIFIED:

**PRIMARY TARGET: $111.5K**
- Zone: MASSIVE LIQUIDATION ZONE
- Intensity: EXTREME (Yellow-Green)
- Liquidations: 205.14M+
- Probability: 85%
- Action: ⛔ AVOID HIGH-LEVERAGE LONGS

**SECONDARY TARGET: $115-120K**
- Zone: SECONDARY SWEEP
- Intensity: HIGH (Cyan-Green)
- Probability: 60%
- Action: ⚠️ CAUTION - May hit before primary

### TRADING STRATEGY:
```
Current Price ($116K+)
        ↓
Secondary Sweep ($115-120K)
        ↓
PRIMARY LIQUIDATION HUNT ($111.5K) ← WHALE MAGNET
        ↓
Accumulation Zone ($110-111K)
        ↓
BULLISH REVERSAL
        ↓
New Highs $120K+
```

**Risk Level:** 🔴 HIGH for longs above $115K
**Opportunity:** 🟢 Reversal entry below $111K after sweep
