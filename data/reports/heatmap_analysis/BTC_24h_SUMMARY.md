## üìä TRADING IMPLICATIONS

### Whale Strategy Decoded:
```
The heatmap reveals a CLASSIC WHALE LIQUIDATION HUNT SETUP:

1. Price currently above $115K
2. Massive yellow-green zone at $111.5K = whale magnet
3. Whales will likely push price DOWN to trigger cascading liquidations
4. Retail longs will get REKT at $111.5K
5. Whales accumulate at discounted prices
6. Price reverses BULLISH after liquidation sweep completes
```

### Risk Zones:
- **DANGER:** $111.5K - DO NOT LONG HERE (liquidation trap)
- **CAUTION:** $115K-$120K - Secondary sweep zone
- **OPPORTUNITY:** Below $111K - Potential reversal entry after sweep

### Recommended Actions:
1. **AVOID:** Opening longs above $115K with high leverage
2. **WAIT:** For $111.5K to be hit and swept
3. **ENTER:** Long positions ONLY after confirmation of whale accumulation below $111K
4. **STOP LOSS:** Tight stops below $110K to avoid further downside
