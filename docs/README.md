# Documentation Overview

This directory collects all project documentation in clearly named subfolders:

- `coinglass/` — CoinGlass automation guides, prompt injections, and workflows.
- `mcp/` — Model Context Protocol resources, split into `chatgpt/` (Codex configuration, Chrome DevTools) and `claude/` (Terminator/ImageSorcery guides, shared notes, power combos).
- `reference/` — General reference material such as API token and endpoint details.

Each subfolder contains its own markdown files and, when helpful, additional subdirectories (e.g., `workflows/`, `security/`). Use this structure to jump straight to the topic you need without digging through the project root.
